# CNN and RNN for DDoS Detection
Project for a 2020 University of York Dissertation project focused on detecting DDoS attacks in known and unknown data using CNNs and RNNs. 

LDAP, NetBIOS, Syn and UDPLag datasets were used from the 03-11 dataset from [CICDDoS2019](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ddos-2019.html).
